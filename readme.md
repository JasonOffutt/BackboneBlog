# BackboneBlog

BackboneBlog is a project created to serve as a reference or style guide for building larger scale applications in Backbone.js. BackboneBlog falls under the MIT license. This isn't meant to be a definitive guide. It may not work for everybody, and may very well be overkill for many projects. This project is merely the result of a compilation of techniques, patterns and ideas I've accumulated through my journey as a JS hacker and people much smarter than me.
